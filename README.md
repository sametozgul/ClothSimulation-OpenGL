# ClothSimulation-OpenGL

This example is the OpenGL version of [FelipesCoding's cloth simulation](https://github.com/FelipesCoding/cloth_simulation.git). It simulates cloth using OpenGL, and Iâ€™ve added mouse callbacks for interaction. Additionally, gravity can be adjusted in real-time on the screen, thanks to ImGUI.
